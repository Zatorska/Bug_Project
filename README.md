## Bug_Project

I created this project to compare two of my passions: **entomology** and **data science** :) 

Problem to solve:

>_In social media, I belong to few groups for people who love insects :) 
I recognized that there are a lot of posts with bugs' pictures and questions:_ 
_* What is it?_ 
_* What is the name of this species? 
_* Is it dangerous?_

Then I started to think that someone would create a programe which takes picture and tells what insect can it be. And suddenly: I could try to do this! It'll be great opportunity to develop my skills!

So...

Bug Project will be a deep learning program which takes a picture of a caterpillar and tells what is the name of this species.

In this Project I'll try to collect data using web scraping methods (in Python).

I just started this project, please be patient :)

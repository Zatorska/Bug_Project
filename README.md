# Bug_Project

I created this project to compare two of my passions: entomology and data science :) 

Problem to solve:

In social media, I belong to few groups for people who love insects :) 
I recognized that there are a lot of posts with bugs' pictures and questions: 

What is it? 
What is the name of this species? 
Is it dangerous? 

Then I started to think that someone would create a programe which takes picture and tells what insect can it be. And suddenly: I could try to do this! It'll be great opportunity to develop my skills!

So..

Bug Project will be a deep learning program which takes a picture of a caterpillar and tells what is the name of this species..
